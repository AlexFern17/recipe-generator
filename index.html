        According to the
        <a href="https://www.unep.org/">UN Environment Programme</a> 2022 there
        were 1.05 billion tonnes of food waste generated (including inedible
        parts), amounting to 132 kilograms per capita and almost one-fifth of
        all food available to consumers. Out of the total food wasted in 2022,
        60 per cent happened at the household level, with food services
        responsible for 28 per cent and retail 12 per cent. <br /><small
